### -I am currently working as a GPU compiler engineer
### -My interests lie primarily in computer architecture, compilers and computer graphics
### -In my spare time, I love reading books (mostly in my interests above) and solving math-related puzzles like programming problems on leetcode, codeforces etc.
### -The stats on leetcode below is nothing, but to make me feel psyched about leetcoding every day I see it. Puzzles are fun, the more you do the more it becomes like gaming!
