### I am currently working as a GPU compiler engineer
### My interests lie primarily in computer architecture, compilers and computer graphics
### In my spare time, I love reading books (mostly in my interests above) and solving math-related puzzles like programming problems on leetcode, codeforces etc.
### The stats on leetcode below is nothing, but to make me feel psyched about leetcoding every day I see it. Frankly, it is a video game which can easily get addicted to so I need to constantly control myself not spending too much time on it and do what i need to do
